# greenscale
low res monochrome experiments for Apple II

Works best in Virtual II. (http://www.virtualii.com/)

Self-booting DSK, runs animation at 46FPS. Loads DATA.BIN directly off disk. Up to 41 frames of animation.

Now has the ability to change the interframe delay. Press + or - to increase or decrease the delay. 

Space bar pauses/restarts the animation.

To convert a GIF (named animation.gif) with the included greenscale.sh script requires ImageMagick and Python. 

Put resulting DATA file on disk as DATA00, optionally with other DATA files named DATA01 through DATA09.
